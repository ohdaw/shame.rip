i didnt mean to piss you off, i was trying to defend you but youre literally not understanding me, your post was directly headed to someone but who does not post about you only says words in servers but doesn’t post about you even if it was everyone posting about trend, and youre the one who posting about him which means obsession towards everyone, and you don’t think twice before posting it, you couldnt stop for a second and think “will this affect my boyfriend?” “ will anyone use this against my boyfriend” now imagine what will would’ve happened to me people would say “aren’t ur girl obsessed over/ posting her ex still?” like what am i suppose to do in this situation at all? why don’t you just ignore everyone who’s meant to be ignored from the past and let them say what they wants to say without having to post on them, ur literally got me with you and im sorry if i was harsh talking to you or hurt you from the words or like being mean and sorry if ive mistaken you
